  """Return the result of combining `mutations` for `num_rounds`.
  Starting with a pool of M `mutations` m_1 ... m_M, stack them for K=`num_rounds` rounds. For example,
  for K=3 rounds of combination, this will result in every variant (m_i + m_j + m_k), for i, j, k \\in M.
  Be careful of memory usage, as this can be very large due to combinatorial possibilities.
  In the best case, this scales with {M \\choose K}. But if mutations overlap at P positions,
  combining them produces 1 + 2^{P} variants. So in the worst case, this will produce
  {M \\choose K} * 2^{P} variants. See the definition for `utils.merge_mutation_sets` for more on
  mutation merging.

    mutations: The starting pool of mutations, where each mutation is an iterable of

  Returns:

    `num_rounds` mutations from `mutations`. Note that each tuple will possibly be of different lengths.
